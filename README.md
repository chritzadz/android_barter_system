# android_barter-system

TradeBarter is a prototype mobile application designed to demonstrate how Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles are applied in Android app development. This app allows users to barter or trade items with others, providing a structured and interactive way to exchange goods without money.

Note: This app is a prototype and is not intended for deployment. It serves as an educational project to showcase OOP concepts, MVVM architecture, and Jetpack Compose in Android development.

Why MVVM? do be extended into more complex design. By default it is based on data-binding

# OOP concepts

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in TradeBarter
TradeBarter is structured using OOP principles to ensure modular, reusable, and maintainable code. Key OOP concepts used in this app include:

Encapsulation: Data classes encapsulate item details, user profiles, and trade interactions.
Inheritance: Base classes and abstract classes provide reusable components for UI and business logic.
Polymorphism: Different types of tradeable items can be handled with shared interfaces or abstract classes.
Abstraction: The MVVM pattern separates UI logic from business logic, improving maintainability.

This prototype is ideal for learning how OOP, MVVM, and Jetpack Compose KOtlin work together in Android development!
